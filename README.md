I'm a technical project lead @ [CRX Markets](https://www.crxmarkets.com). I'm most proficient in Java, Scala and JavaScript. But I also like to try something new once in a while.

I write about software development in my blog [on Medium](https://medium.com/@forketyfork) and in my [Telegram channel](https://t.me/ktimlidu). I also try to help out fellow programmers on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1336841/sergei?tab=profile)
